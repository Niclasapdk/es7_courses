# Choosing a Lens to Photograph the Leaning Tower of Pisa

## Assumptions
- **Subject:** Leaning Tower of Pisa, height H ≈ 56 m  
- **Framing margin:** 20% head/foot → framed height H_m = 1.2 × H = 67.2 m  
- **Placement:** camera on tripod at D = 150 m from the tower  
- **Camera:** full-frame (36 × 24 mm sensor), vertical sensor size s_v = 24 mm

## Geometry → Focal length
Use this simple focal-length formula (no special math rendering needed):

`f [mm] = (s_v [mm] * D [m]) / H_m [m]`

### Calculation (numbers)
`f = (24 * 150) / 67.2 ≈ 53.6 mm` → **≈ 54 mm**

## Recommendation
- **Full-frame:** ~**50–55 mm** lens at 150 m  
- **APS-C** (vertical ≈ 15.7 mm): ~**35 mm** at 150 m  
- **Micro Four Thirds** (vertical ≈ 13 mm): ~**29 mm** at 150 m

## Quick reference (20% margin)
| Distance to tower | Full-frame (s_v=24 mm) | APS-C (s_v≈15.7 mm) | MFT (s_v≈13 mm) |
|---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 100 m | ~36 mm | ~23 mm | ~19 mm |
| 150 m | ~54 mm | ~35 mm | ~29 mm |
| 200 m | ~71 mm | ~47 mm | ~39 mm |

## Practical tips
- Keep the camera position fixed between sessions (perspective depends on camera placement, not focal length).  
- Include fixed reference marks in frame (base markers, a vertical mast or plumb line) to measure tiny angular changes.  
- Lock geometry: tripod height, focal length, manual focus, and framing.  
- Shoot a short burst and average frames to reduce atmospheric shimmer.
